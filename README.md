# Channel-aware CSI Feedback: Dataset Bias Mitigated Pre-training, Online Out-of-Distribution Detection and its Domain Adaptation


## Simulation Result and Analysis
### A. Evaluation of Channel-aware CSI Feedback in the Model Training Phase
#### Experiment Setup
This subsection first verifies the bias mitigation and performance of the channel-aware CSI feedback paradigm pre-trained on mixed datasets under different setups. The efficiency of the channel-aware CSI feedback to mitigate dataset bias of the offline pre-train dataset collected from 5 multiple channel configurations is evaluated, and the downlink channels are collected in a perfect downlink channel estimation mode with the setting of the following table.
